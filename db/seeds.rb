Post.create({title: "What's the good news?", link: "whats_the_good_news", body: "I have a confession to make: projects have never been my strong suit. So despite knowing very well that my CLI project was coming up, it still snuck up on me. I needed to extract data from a website and present that to a user. Half the battle was going to be in simply choosing an idea! Luckily, it didn't take long for my initial apprehension to turn to excitement.

The media focus on shocking, scary, and negative stories is a known problem. People are increasingly stressed and scared, even as things improve, because we're surrounded by the bad news. Lightbulb! I could scrape a website dedicated to positive news stories and bring them to a user through a CLI application. Once I had that down, the rest fell into place. While object oriented programming was a lot at first, it was surprisingly intuitive as I brainstormed. Get articles off the page, present them to the user - *scrape* the page, make *articles*, present them (through the *CLI*). My objects came to be even before the right website had.

My brainstorming took part largely on paper, in fact I have two whole mock interactions between the user and the CLI written in a notebook. A fair amount of my planning time was looking at websites that actually deliver positive news stories. I found [Good News Network](http://www.goodnewsnetwork.org) and spent some time inspecting the page to see what I might be getting into once I had to sift through the HTML. Then came the real trouble with coding outside the comfort of the Learn IDE: Bundler knows what a gem should look like, while I do not. Or, I **didn't**. A hands-on learner through and through, I was more excited than overwhelmed with the ability to tinker, break, and fix things all on my own. 

I ran into some trouble on day two of coding, when I learned that a selector I chose was subject to change. After some time trying to do things the hard way, it occurred to me that in my quest to scrape everything I needed in one step, I'd forgotten that arrays are fairly easy to operate on - especially when you simply don't want the first element. Laziness may be a virtue, but it would seem I'm still working on being flexible in how I choose to be lazy.

In all, I've learned a lot about myself. I love pry, I might need to be lazier, and I absolutely love getting to decide for myself what classes and methods I'll be using. And last but certainly not least, I got to watch my idea grow and turn into a happy little CLI (are you channeling Bob Ross? I am.) that can deliver a bit of joy."})
